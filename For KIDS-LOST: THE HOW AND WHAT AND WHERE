📻 THE SONGS: Your Feature Guide

TRACK 1: "Here Comes the Carnival"

"Here comes the carnival, here comes the carnival / Roll up, roll up, roll up"

THIS IS THE QUEST SYSTEM!

When you hear this song, think about:

· Quests appearing like carnival games to play
· Your particles becoming the carnival workers, barkers, performers
· You walking through the midway, choosing what to try

Your carnival games (quest types):

Game Quest Type Example
Tilt-A-Whirl Exploration quest "Explore 10 new tiles"
Ring Toss Collection quest "Gather 5 rare resources"
Fun House Puzzle quest "Solve the mystery"
Tunnel of Love Relationship quest "Help two particles bond"
Strength Test Combat quest "Defeat the rival particle"
Fortune Teller Mystery quest "Discover what's hidden"

---

TRACK 2: "The Stalker"

"I'm gonna stalk this hoochie, I'm gonna watch her every move"

THIS IS THE SOLO QUEST SYSTEM!

When particles are doing things without you, they're "stalking" the world:

· They watch what other particles do
· They follow their interests
· They get curious, they explore
· They might even follow YOU when you're not paying attention

What they do alone:

```python
# They might:
- Explore new areas ("I wonder what's over there...")
- Follow interesting particles ("That one looks cool")
- Gather resources ("I need more of THIS")
- Practice skills ("I want to get better at THAT")
- Make friends ("Hey, you seem nice")
- Start drama ("Did you see what THEY did?")
```

---

TRACK 3: "Be Safe"

"Watch your step, watch your step / Take it easy, take it easy"

THIS IS THE CHAT SYSTEM!

When particles talk, they're checking in, sharing, warning each other:

· "Be safe out there"
· "Watch your step in the mountains"
· "Take it easy today"
· "I'm here if you need me"

Chat safety features:

```
NEARBY CHAT: "The mines are dangerous today, be careful!"
GROUP CHAT: "Everyone check in, are we all safe?"
DIRECT: "Hey, you seemed down earlier. You okay?"
```

---

TRACK 4: "Fuck Regret"

"Ain't no pause to this life of yours but you can always hit eject / I'm screaming 'Fuck regret!'"

THIS IS THE BOND SYSTEM!

No regrets about who you bond with, how deep you go:

· Bonds can grow without limit
· No looking back, only forward
· If it doesn't work, you move on
· Every connection teaches something

Bond wisdom:

· "Ain't no pause" — Relationships keep evolving
· "You can always hit eject" — You can leave anytime, no hard feelings
· "Fuck regret" — Never regret loving, even if it ends

---

TRACK 5: "Bitch I'm Fine"

"Woe is me, woe is me / Plus I got molded teeth / Bitch, I'm fine"

THIS IS THE GROWTH SYSTEM!

Particles can be broken and still beautiful:

· Low energy? Fine.
· Anxious? Fine.
· Confused? Fine.
· Growing through struggle? FINE.

Growth through hardship:

· Molded teeth → Still smile
· Rusted parts → Still work
· Broken pieces → Still whole
· Weathered by time → Still here
