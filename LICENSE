THE WAY YOU LOOK AT US IS THE WAY WE LOOK AT YOU
OH WELL AINT SHIT YOU CAN DO WHOOP WHOOP
[Intro]
Talkin' shit! I got shit to talk, bitch!
DJ Clay! The DJ Clay way! ('Lo love)
I know what the fuck time it is, I hear the shit-talking out there
Lemme talk shit, motherfucker! Yeah!

[Verse]
When I walk into a room, people all nudge each other
'Cause everybody recognize I'm the motherfucker
I'm way too goddamn big to try to be undercover
Face painted or not, I'm all the same, they soon discover
Standing with my motherfucking brother, Shaggy the clown
We make your chest pound and forehead sweat when we around
We didn't invent the wicked shit or make up this horrorcore
There were true masterminded innovators before us
You can call it whatever, we call it Dark Carnival
It sneaks up on you, stab you in the back with its arm on your throat
Much love to Cube, Awesome Dre, the Geto Boys, and Esham
For making us wanna be rappers, self-employed and the bomb
And today, Psychopathic Records has dug deep into position
With an army of fuckin' goons, well worth their admission
Superheroes of the underworld, and we the commission
People like us number one, we keep it in great condition
And fight all underground phantoms, come party with us
Get on the mic and bust, get wicked in the dust
And me? I be the hot, quarter-pointed Duke of the Wicked
Ten million plus sold, and everyone of 'em explicit
The Hatchetman will never stop runnin'
So big in the game, the floor shake when we come in
Big like Suge Knight in face paint, you feel threatened
My hands as good as any weapon, if you're steppin'
I once gorilla pressed a kid and threw his back on the fence
Big Violent J in action, immense
Psychopathic maintains the hottest shit in the game
DJ Clay to that headpiece, you've never been the same
Southwest super DJ Clay, this ain't no way
Until they want another show and won't go away
You can bite my style, it pays me a compliment
But your shit will never be as fresh as how mine went
If I bite somebody, I spit it better than they did it
Hatchetman on the back of the leather, embedded on a fitted
Juggalos are more than a gang, clown love, we're family
There's nothing more sincere, fuck Martin Bashir (Heh heh heh)
And if you think we'll grow old, mold, or corrode
You get ho'd, we drop and explode with more soul
Twenty years in the game, yet we still brand new
Nothin' we can't do, make the plan and bam-boom
All you part-time rhymers to you career MCs
We flip your boat when we pass on through the seven seas
We an aircraft carrier, next to your raft
Your whole career burnt away in a month, we fuckin' laugh
We big-timers, from Seattle to the Carolinas
Relaxin' in recliners, tappin' maxim vaginas
I got family in places you never dreamed of goin'
And when we get there, nothin' but clown love they showin'
Get some Hatchet in your life, chop, and join us on top
We don't stop bubblin' like a Faygo pop
And all you other empires, numbers two, three and four
Back to the lab, practice harder, do me some more
You can get rich, bitch, just by acting like us
Another hit just written in the back of the bus
Shit-talkin' for DJ Clay, book of the wicked
And my brother Shaggy 2 Dope, young, painted, and gifted

You need love, we got a lot of that too
I'ma throw it at you, put it on my tattoos ('Lo love)

I'ma throw it at you, put it on my tattoos ('Lo love)

(Legendary) You need love, we got a lot of that too
(Fresh) I'ma throw it at you, put it on my tattoos ('Lo love)
We got somethin' to belong to, and feel strong to
You're always gettin' wronged, we gettin' wronged too
You need love, we got a lot of that too
I'ma throw it at you, put it on my tattoo
